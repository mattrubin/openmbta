# OpenMBTA

The [OpenMBTA](http://openmbta.org) iOS app gives current schedule information for [MBTA](http://mbta.com) buses, commuter rail lines, subway, and ferries.


## CocoaPods

This project uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management. Once CocoaPods is [installed](http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/installing_cocoapods.html), you can download the external libraries by running the following from the project directory:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

From now on, use `OpenMBTA.xcworkspace` instead of `OpenMBTA.xcodeproj` to open the project.

``` bash
$ open OpenMBTA.xcworkspace
```
